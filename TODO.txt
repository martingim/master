MATLAB
	add higher order stokes solutions to the plots 
	for velocity and alpha


	use sensor offset in surface height script
	to add more sensors
BASILISK
	compare mesh refinement results
	use the wavemaker theory on a larger domain



Surface height sensors
    check to see if I can find the distance between the sensors in overleaf or lab journal
