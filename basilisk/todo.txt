multlayer solver with boundary conditions from piston file
multilayer large wavetank
multilayer large wavetank multiple paddles


check surface probes for all runs 

change dimensions to 7x7    


* test one large piston multilayer vs ns time and surface elevation
* compare one piston scalar field to 14
* change the piston to use only one field

*compare boundary piston to stephane trick for normal and higher amplitude
