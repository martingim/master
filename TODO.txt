change the masking in stokes-ns-mask to scale the simulation length to one wavelength
	which will hopefully get the coordinates right in paraview

Test if Paraview trace works at home
	check paraview version
	check python paraview version 

keep trying to get multilayer solver to work in 2d
 
Surface height sensors
    check to see if I can find the distance between the sensors in overleaf or lab journal

    use sensor offset in surface height script
