# Movies showcasing different simulations of wavetank with piston
## Different ways of handling the top boundary
The bottom simulation with a coarser mesh above the waves is the most stable and destroys the vortexes in the air phase before the reach the top boundary. 
The file [piston.c](https://github.com/martingim/master/blob/main/basilisk/2d_piston/boundary-piston/piston.c) is used to generate these results.
