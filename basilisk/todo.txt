introduction
    initialised stokes wave with periodic boundaries
        multilayer and NS
            check stability and the evolution of the simulation

2d 
    compare multilayer vs NS vs NS_stephane_trick
        compare with probe at 1.5m and 10m
        compare vertical velocity profile with theory and PIV
    run a 2d focusing wave

3d 
    One large piston to compare with 2d results
        check if the waves have the same breaking point as in 2d
        
    pistons offset from each other
    
    make 3d focusing wave
        Check how steep it can get without breaking
            if we can get close to 3 times steeper than 2d




multlayer solver with boundary conditions from piston file
multilayer large wavetank
multilayer large wavetank multiple paddles


check surface probes for all runs 

change dimensions to 7x7    


* test one large piston multilayer vs ns time and surface elevation
* compare one piston scalar field to 14
* change the piston to use only one field

*compare boundary piston to stephane trick for normal and higher amplitude

*check if ditching adapt and only setting initial refinement is faster/better


*check the different piston implementations for simulation speed (both stephane and boundary)
    one piston field changed when setting every piston speed and position
