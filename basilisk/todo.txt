introduction
    initialised stokes wave with periodic boundaries
        check the same with much smaller wave
        Check the effect of changing DT
        multilayer and NS
            check stability and the evolution of the simulation

2d 
    check energy decay for short timeseries piston movement
    compare multilayer vs NS vs NS_stephane_trick
        check ml difference with nh.h
        compare with probe at 1.5m and 10m
        compare vertical velocity profile with theory and PIV


3d 
    One large piston to compare with 2d results
        check if the waves have the same breaking point as in 2d
        
    pistons offset from each other
    
    make 3d focusing wave
        Check how steep it can get without breaking
            if we can get close to 3 times steeper than 2d


*test one large piston multilayer vs ns time and surface elevation

*compare boundary piston to stephane trick for normal and higher amplitude

*check if ditching adapt and only setting initial refinement is faster/better

*test results without conserving.h

*check the different piston implementations for simulation speed (both stephane and boundary)


RESULTS
    piston position files argumentation for using fil3.dat and change the factor to m i matlab
